# Haskell Weekly

Publishes curated news about Haskell.

This repository is a work in progress. It's goal is to bring together the
following repos into one:

- [haskellweekly.github.io](https://github.com/haskellweekly/haskellweekly.github.io):
  The main newsletter. This also includes the yearly surveys.

- [podcast](https://github.com/haskellweekly/podcast):
  The auxiliary podcast.

- [reveille](https://github.com/haskellweekly/reveille):
  The defunct feed aggregator.

Haskell Weekly makes use of the following services:

- [Name.com](https://www.name.com):
  Registers domain names.

- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com):
  Provides DNS servers and CDNs.

- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com):
  Hosts media files such as podcast episodes.

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com):
  Also host media files in a slightly different way.

- [GitHub](https://mailchimp.com):
  Hosts source code. (Currently provides static site hosting, but this
  repository will move away from that.)

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com):
  Hosts dynamic web applications such as this one.

- [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com):
  Sends emails and manages subscriber information.

- [Square](https://squareup.com):
  Accepts payments for advertisements.

- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com):
  Announcements and community interaction.

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com):
  Also announcements and community interaction.

- [Airtable](https://airtable.com):
  Manages featured author information. (This repository will eventually take
  on this functionality.)

- [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com):
  Provides event information. (Their API is changing soon, so this will
  probably go away.)

- [Discourse](https://discourse.haskell.org):
  Also also announcements and community interaction. (Unfortunately engagement
  here is low, so this might go away soon.)

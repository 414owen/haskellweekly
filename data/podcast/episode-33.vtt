00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.440
>> Hello

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.390
and welcome to the Haskell weekly podcast. I am your host

3
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.230
today. Cameron Gera, Uh, engineer I.T.

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.730
pro T.V.. And with me today we have a

5
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.230
coworker of mine and my boss

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.650
Taylor. How's it going, man?

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.160
>> It's going good. Thanks for having me on the show camp.

8
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.650
>> Yeah, man, you know, figured you know, we're in a

9
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.360
new year. So happy 2021. Everyone

10
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.260
on Do you know, we got to take a timeto look

11
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.190
back at what we have come from, You know, 2020

12
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.140
was filled with a lot of stuff. You know, we all

13
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.990
transition to work from home. We all figured out

14
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.550
how to communicate still without in face

15
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.530
meetings and figured out how to use Zoom, which

16
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.280
some of us are still questionable. That speaking about lots of

17
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.910
>> programs we got, zoom, we got teams, we got

18
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.470
discord. We tried a bunch of others

19
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.050
>> that we did, but

20
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.800
hey, we're making it through, you know, day by day

21
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.710
on bond. Thank you, listeners joining us today, but

22
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.690
yes. So today we're gonna talk about a little bit about 2020 for us

23
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.570
on Ben also, uh, kind of dive into a

24
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.210
post that was written by Adam West

25
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.020
Peyser about lessons learned from a year

26
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.980
of writing. Haskell, which is a great

27
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.960
post, definitely would encourage you. It's and, um,

28
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.600
addition to

29
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.460
41

30
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.000
>> 2, 45. I've lost track of the issue

31
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.670
numbers of Haskell Weekly, which, you know, you think if

32
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.100
anybody knew, I would know. But it's 2

33
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.980
45. It's the most recent one. So I guess

34
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.850
this is Yeah. This is from 2 45 e mean, it was

35
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.960
easy when I was on issue, like, seven.

36
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.870
But when you're up in the two hundreds, it's been a

37
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.870
>> while. Yeah, we've got got a lot. So yeah, go check

38
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.600
it out. Issue to 45 of High School

39
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.940
Weekly on This is the 33rd

40
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.730
episode of High School Weekly Podcast. So,

41
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.660
you know, we're getting up there. We're gonna start losing count of these as well.

42
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.650
But you know, so today we're gonna talk about

43
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.520
this post by Adam, and he actually gives a

44
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.420
shout out the Haskell week. Lisa. Thank you, Adam. Work. Glad you

45
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.880
had, um, enjoy the weekly

46
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.570
update of what's happening in the world of high school. Uh,

47
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.570
you know, it's definitely a kind of a

48
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.330
sparse field sometimes. And so we have a

49
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.180
place like Haskell Weekly to go and, you know, read

50
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.160
articles about high school and other functional programming languages.

51
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.500
It's kind of funny.

52
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.950
>> Funny you mention that because when I started Haskell

53
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.930
Weekly, I was afraid that some weeks there just

54
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.890
wouldn't be anything or there'd be, like, two links

55
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.820
to publish or something like that. And surprisingly, that has never

56
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.320
been the case. There's never been a shortage of content.

57
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.690
So, uh, just, I guess,

58
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.310
thank from me. Thank you to the whole high school

59
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.670
community for writing so much good stuff with such

60
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.460
regularity. It makes my job collecting all of

61
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.560
it a lot easier.

62
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.500
>> Exactly. Yeah, I would also have that

63
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.060
fear. I think of starting some sort of weekly

64
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.020
news pot meal news, grouping off

65
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.980
articles and then not have anything to post. But, you

66
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.950
know, high school weekly high school community

67
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.580
is coming in strong for sure.

68
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.570
Haskell Weekly, um but awesome. All right, Taylor. Well, I

69
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.410
want to kind of jump in, um and I want you to kind of share maybe

70
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.880
some of the highlights of your 2020

71
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.810
and you know something you've learned, you know,

72
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.770
work or high school related. Um, that,

73
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.170
you know, you were like, Oh, this is pretty sweet,

74
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.260
>> man. You think I would have prepped for this? But

75
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.180
questions catch me a little off guard. I'm gonna stall

76
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.040
and pull one of the quotes that Adam put in this article that I really

77
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.570
agreed with. And I'm not sure that it's something that has

78
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.320
changed for me in 2020. But he

79
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.260
says that an important perspective when writing code is

80
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.800
understanding how it will exist through

81
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.600
time and what demands will be placed on it and how the

82
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.410
fundamental assumptions that code makes will inevitably

83
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.250
change. And for me, and my career is a

84
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.770
software engineer. That's something that I've just

85
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.570
seen come true over and over again where,

86
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.160
like sometimes there's a

87
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.140
focus on how do I make this code as clever

88
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.490
or performance or whatever is possible in

89
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.870
isolation. But really, what's important is like,

90
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.280
is it easy to change over time? And even

91
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.080
as it passes hands, you know, through a team or something like that,

92
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.990
at least in my career, that's the thing that has been important because I've worked

93
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.920
on long running software with large teams

94
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.590
of people or maybe large is a misnomer. I

95
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.430
typically work for startups, so, you know, like less than

96
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.390
10 people. But more than one. That's that's large,

97
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.860
I think.

98
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:29.610
>> Yeah,

99
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.300
e Think any

100
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.580
programmer knows that, you know, Could you, right?

101
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.270
55 minutes ago is now legacy.

102
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.090
Something has changed

103
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.620
because we experienced that everyday. Working through a

104
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.500
legacy a p I that I've been

105
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.470
that I.T. pro for a long time. I literally just

106
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.270
today I was looking at code I wrote in JavaScript

107
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.270
four years ago and I was like, Wow,

108
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.680
>> you were a different person back then.

109
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.680
>> Yeah, yeah, It's like this is gonna

110
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.190
be great. It's awesome. Now it's trash. But that's

111
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.790
okay. You know, we've learned on well,

112
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.150
>> and now it's in the trash. So we're

113
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.000
>> belong, Yes, delete over 5000

114
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.500
lines of code today. So that's that's a good day.

115
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.400
Good day at the office. Eso thats

116
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.550
why

117
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.330
>> a non answer to your question? Cam, what's your answer

118
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.900
about

119
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.820
>> 2020? I mean, actually, it's funny because this

120
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.190
is something Adam kind of mentioned at one point,

121
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.130
um, is using stack

122
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.980
or not Stack Well, yes, using that, he

123
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.840
does mention that he's been using that. But what I meant to say

124
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.520
is he's been using servant or you

125
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.330
mentioned servant assed faras, like some type level

126
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.800
shenanigans that you can kind of learn that

127
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.670
will, you know, really be

128
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.950
helpful in the long run. And I think we've

129
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.270
really benefited from switching r a p

130
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.160
I over to servant and slowly moving routes

131
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.960
over because, you know, we've been getting documentation for

132
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.670
free. We've been getting, ah, lot of, you know,

133
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.310
benefits out of switching over to servant

134
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.960
>> testing for free. Certain types of tests. Yeah,

135
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.620
>> we're testing for free. We get a lot of great benefits

136
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.440
from over some of the other. You know, our other

137
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.310
AP that we framework we use half stack, you know,

138
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.910
have stock was good at the time, but now we've kind of

139
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.840
understood the fundamentals of Haskell a little bit better, and we

140
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.640
can kind of conceptualized type levels. And Anne, it's a little bit

141
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.640
more as a team. And so I'm really happy that our teams kind of

142
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.370
just taking servant by storm and

143
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.310
really, you know, just really creating

144
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.200
on a P I. That's a joy to work. And, um,

145
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.050
especially as a way of FBI

146
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.780
>> and that, you know, touches on something else that Adam talks about in this

147
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.630
post of in general, preferring to write

148
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.550
junior code but

149
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.100
knowing the team you're with and knowing what they can handle

150
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.080
and changing what you write to fit that so for

151
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.920
me, you know, one of the reasons that we were using Half

152
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.780
Stack was that it is. I mean, it's

153
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.650
got some complicated stuff behind the scenes, but generally when you use it, it's

154
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.490
pretty straightforward. It's just like, right stuff in Amman ad and

155
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.420
it'll work. Um, whereas servant has a much higher

156
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.970
bar to clear and you get a lot of benefits from it. But

157
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.850
I have been pleasantly

158
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.490
surprised that our team, which has quite a few junior

159
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.860
engineers on it that are not familiar with Haskell,

160
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.850
um has been able to pick up servant and run with it. It's

161
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:16.370
been great.

162
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.390
>> Yeah, yeah, I think you know that Helps toe

163
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.930
have also senior people on the team that

164
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.780
have kind of led the way. Um, and kind

165
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.710
of I know demystified some

166
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.480
of what's happening, eh? So we can all kind of learn from one

167
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.230
another. Um, really? Well, and I think, honestly,

168
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.060
2020 was a year that we had to

169
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.980
grow together, you know, in a different kind of way. You know, usually

170
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.770
we're in the office, and we're sitting next to each other, and, you know,

171
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.770
we always We've been preparing for a long time, but I think

172
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.910
at this 0.2020 kind of push just to

173
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.190
be even a tighter knit group

174
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.830
where, you know, we're communicating better. We're

175
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.430
teaching each other, you know, healthy habits

176
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.150
and just really, you know, helping each other,

177
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.480
uh, build together as our company slogan

178
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.370
currently is, Uh,

179
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.280
but you know, that Z you know, that's

180
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.280
what 2020 really offered us. So, you know, I'm

181
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.270
really thankful for that on, but I think you

182
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.020
know, for us as a team, we're

183
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.950
like, what? Your to your three of high school

184
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.240
writing Three. Little more

185
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.130
>> than three. Because I joined right after y'all had

186
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.110
switched toe Haskell and I'm coming up on my third

187
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.470
year.

188
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.020
>> Mm. Okay. Yeah. So we're in

189
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.670
three years of writing high school, and, you know, I think last year was

190
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.340
really ah year that we

191
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.340
stopped worrying about JavaScript code or

192
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.260
worrying about migrations from various platforms. And we

193
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.980
have been just really solely working on

194
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.740
three I.T. pro T.V. product s. So I think that

195
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.740
was really great. Um,

196
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.530
>> yeah. And I'm sure that, you know, the remote

197
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.160
members of our team are very glad that

198
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.170
we're remote first. Now, everyone's

199
00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.040
in the same shoes that they've been in the whole time. So we

200
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.240
understand their plight a little better.

201
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:05.560
>> Um oh, yeah.

202
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.170
Um, but yeah. So back to the post to

203
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.670
is he He talks about

204
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.160
type level witnesses, which he tried out. Hey,

205
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.690
had a little little difficulty. Um,

206
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.690
honestly, I really never heard of, you

207
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.640
know, the type of witnesses. So I really should probably

208
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.370
follow the block posts because he linked to

209
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.800
a type level witness block post. So I

210
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.580
should definitely check that out. But do you know anything

211
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.170
about that?

212
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.430
>> I don't. I pulled up the block post, so I'm trying to scan it really

213
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.110
quick. If I had to guess, I think this would be about

214
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.660
the like, um, ghosts of

215
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.650
departed proofs paper where

216
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.910
you encode information in the

217
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.550
at the type level, so that once you

218
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.970
prove something via like a smart

219
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.960
constructor, you have evidence of that proof that you

220
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.870
can carry along. So the canonical example would

221
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.520
be like, um, you have proved that a

222
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.330
number is odd. So now you're type is odd

223
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.250
number rather than just number into juror or whatever.

224
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.510
Um, and in general, like, you could do that

225
00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.460
with new type rappers for any particular type. But

226
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.010
in general, if you want to connect like,

227
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.710
uh, refinements or constraints to

228
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.680
stuff, there's a mawr principled way to do all of

229
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.370
that. And I think that's what this type level witness stuff

230
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.850
is. Although maybe I could be grossly

231
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.730
misrepresenting it. So I apologize. If I am,

232
00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.730
>> maybe we'll cover that in another weeks of

233
00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.550
high school weekly podcast here, you know,

234
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.840
um, but yeah. Okay. So thank you for

235
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.410
trying to give me some insight there.

236
00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:40.980
Yeah,

237
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.860
>> and so my my reading of his,

238
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.870
you know, hesitation about using type level witnesses is

239
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.730
that they are nice and they give you some good

240
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.250
things. But the interface for using them is

241
00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.450
two clunky or too complex or too difficult for him,

242
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.640
which I think is a fair complaint. Not just about type

243
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.450
level witnesses, but many things

244
00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.450
and type level high school. And, you know, for me, that was one of

245
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.360
the reasons I push back on Servant for so

246
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.170
long is like Well, yeah, I can see all the benefits, but

247
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.860
I'm not sure what all the downsides are.

248
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.360
>> Yeah, yeah, it definitely you with

249
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.600
high overhead to understand. Something

250
00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.610
really tends to rub me the wrong way as well,

251
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.360
because I'm like, Well, you know, it's not just me

252
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.140
at that writing this code like it's an entire

253
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.120
team. We all need to be ableto handle this. And

254
00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:33.060
if it's clunky and harder to use like it's just not

255
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.110
ready, then you know.

256
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.050
>> And it's not only is it hard to write or

257
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.820
use but, like, maintain or understand when

258
00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.430
something goes wrong. We ran into that the other day with

259
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.240
Servant, where we had moved on in

260
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.990
point from our old service to our new one. And it

261
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.770
wasn't behaving the same. And like everything we could look at was the

262
00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.570
same. It was, oh, something behind the scenes that servant is

263
00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.530
doing. It's actually Mawr correct and like, it's good

264
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.370
that it's doing that thing, but we weren't aware of

265
00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:02.200
that. So it was hard for us to debug this problem because we were

266
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.750
looking at our application code rather than the, you know,

267
00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.220
servant code,

268
00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.340
>> right? Yeah. But, you

269
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.340
know, with time, everybody kinda can work through those clunks

270
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.320
and, you know, maybe Adam in 2021

271
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.260
can, you know, master with, you know, type

272
00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.130
level witnesses, and you look forward Thio reading

273
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.990
his post next January E

274
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:24.970
>> finally figured out Type

275
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.650
>> level witnesses, Yes, or maybe. Hey,

276
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.630
if you want to write it in 2021 I'm all for

277
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.970
it. Definitely down there to check it out.

278
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.570
Ah, yeah. Um

279
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.830
so I think this is something we faced,

280
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.180
and we've gone through many iterations of

281
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.510
build systems and, you know,

282
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.360
we've we're using Stack, but we know it's

283
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.150
limitations, and we're we rub up against it. We thought

284
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.120
about Nick's like, and he kind

285
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.970
of mentioned this in the block post, and he's kind of gives

286
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.950
his his two cents per se about it, Um,

287
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.590
which I thought was was informative. I think

288
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.750
you know, for us we want

289
00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.320
all the cash and we could get so if we could do Knicks like

290
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.860
we're all about it. But like he says, it's a little complicated

291
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.150
until we've kind of, you know, we have some team

292
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.040
members who use Nick's ls and they will not be

293
00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.040
named their great. Uh, but

294
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.250
>> names have been changed to protect the innocent.

295
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.060
Yeah, I mean, Knicks has been like a pipe dream for us

296
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.990
for years and not so much like

297
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.820
nix the technology but the stuff that it brings. Like you

298
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.740
mentioned with cashing because we have spent ah lot

299
00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.440
of engineering hours trying to get the cashing not

300
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.770
only on our local machines, but on C I,

301
00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.230
uh, to get are cashing in a good place with stacks so that we

302
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.180
don't spend, you know, 15 minutes waiting for a really small

303
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.960
change to go through our C I process.

304
00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.370
>> Yeah. So you're saying if we could get the cash

305
00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:51.450
right, we would save a lot of

306
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.040
cash?

307
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.440
Very true. Yeah. Yeah, You're welcome.

308
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.060
I'll be here all year. Maybe

309
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.490
outrage from from viewers. Get this

310
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.750
kid off of this way. Can't handle those

311
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.940
>> Haskell puns anymore. Kick him off the

312
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:09.760
podcast.

313
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.980
>> He's out of here. All right, Well, then you'll get

314
00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.280
tailored by himself because we my friends

315
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.170
>> were Justus Bad

316
00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.460
>> Fair. But hey, at least we've got them, right? That jokes for

317
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:20.990
days.

318
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.730
>> Yeah. Um, but yeah, I I liked

319
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.580
hearing his take on build systems because

320
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.380
it kind of matches ours. Like we're using Stack. There are some things

321
00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:32.100
about it that annoy us, but not enough to push us on.

322
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.100
Anything else and something like next would be great. We

323
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.050
could probably get away with using COBOL directly, but Stack gives

324
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.760
us some niceties that we want to stick with. Although I was

325
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.650
surprised to hear that this, like, flat name

326
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:46.650
space area that he mentions. I don't think I've ever seen that. And we have

327
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.330
eight people working on stack working with

328
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.080
stack all day every day. Um,

329
00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.790
so I don't know. He says the dreaded like it's some well known

330
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.000
thing I have never seen. Knock on

331
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.940
>> wood. Same. Yeah. Tomorrow. Coming

332
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.850
to work tomorrow. Saturday. But come

333
00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:04.260
in Monday, and it's gonna be just like,

334
00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.060
uh, nobody can work today. We're all

335
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.990
work through this problem together. Uh, but

336
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.870
yeah. So then he moves on from build systems to kind

337
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.440
off some of the tools which I guess

338
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.350
can play into the build system. Uh, but,

339
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.080
you know, it sounds like he's a G.H.C. I.T. fan, which

340
00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:24.370
we hear it I.T. pro T.V. are also

341
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.800
G.H.C. defense.

342
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.830
>> Yeah, it's surprising how helpful G.H.C.

343
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.820
ideas, given that it's such a simple tool like it

344
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.800
hardly does anything in principle. It's like if you

345
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.670
started G.H.C. I and just hit colon reload

346
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.470
over and over again every time you saved a file. But

347
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.230
that's really helpful. I mean, G.H.C. is a nice

348
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.030
compiler, especially once you're familiar with

349
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.870
how it reports errors to you, right?

350
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.090
Um but yeah, that, like G.H.C. i

351
00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.830
d by itself is great. So thank you, Neil

352
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:56.250
Mitchell, for starting that

353
00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.180
>> woof. Yeah, And then we've got you know,

354
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.180
something? I think we've tried here. It I.T. pro. At least a few of us

355
00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.060
have is getting high school language server

356
00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:08.760
up and going. Um, you know,

357
00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.370
we've caused some crashes from that.

358
00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.210
>> I was going to say it's a running joke that when one of

359
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.020
our one of the guys on our team runs HLs, it's like,

360
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.770
Well, his machine is gonna crash sometime in the next 48

361
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.820
hours. We don't know when, but it will

362
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.770
>> happen. Yeah, but, I mean, that would

363
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.010
work if you turn the machine off

364
00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.950
>> every night. But yeah. And this was a long time ago that this,

365
00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.860
you know, internal name came up, So I'm sure HLS

366
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.710
is better. Um, but we haven't tried it in the

367
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:35.250
meantime.

368
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.860
>> Yeah, Yeah, it's been a minute. Um,

369
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.530
because H l s and h i e all

370
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.110
kind of merged

371
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.030
>> together, right? I have not been able to keep track

372
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.940
of all the naming, emerging, but I think that's true or

373
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.370
HLs includes h i e or something like that.

374
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.440
Mhm. Yeah, Yeah, they

375
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.330
fixed a bunch of memory leaks, and supposedly, it's a lot better and

376
00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.360
faster now, but I haven't given another chance.

377
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.540
>> Yeah, you know, I just use this little

378
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.300
Adam, uh, V s code plug in called

379
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.170
Probably yoke. Does this guy made e

380
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.050
>> didn't wanna plug my own plug in, but yes, I

381
00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.640
wrote one called Purple Yoke, and it behaves a lot like

382
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.310
G.H.C. I.T. where really it just spins up

383
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.280
G.H.C. I in the background and reloads it for you a bunch and gives

384
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.140
you the little red squiggly underlines which works really

385
00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.640
>> well for me. Hey, More to come in

386
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.860
2021 Probably.

387
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:28.850
>> Yeah. I might make, like three commits to it this

388
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.660
>> year if we could

389
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.400
get, like, a quick jump or something working with it.

390
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:34.800
Uh,

391
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:37.540
>> well, yeah, I was gonna say one of the other tools that he mentions his Haskell

392
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.350
tags, and that has been really useful again. It's like

393
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.300
a relatively simple tool, and it doesn't do a

394
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.950
whole lot, But just being able to say, like, keyboard

395
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.880
shortcut jumped aware this thing is defined amazingly

396
00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.490
useful because I do that all the time And what I used to do was

397
00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:54.330
selected and search through the whole project for it. And then, like, oh,

398
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.550
no, these air you call sites, not definition sites.

399
00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.610
>> Yeah, it's a cave man.

400
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.450
E I still I'm

401
00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:02.490
stuck doing that because

402
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.440
e I guess I lost

403
00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.380
my hashtags configuration or something along those lines with

404
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.160
V s code. But eso I really haven't been

405
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.030
doing that. I've been doing the control shift f with the highlighted

406
00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.480
word and yeah, then being like,

407
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.880
uh, scroll, scroll, scroll! Oh, there it It's

408
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.750
OK, Nita, Maybe that's one of

409
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.160
my 2021 resolutions. Just get that

410
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.270
get away. Working again? Yeah,

411
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.560
It's like it's one of those things. Like it

412
00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.580
broke, but it wasn't a huge inconvenience.

413
00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.670
Yeah, I don't know. I guess I have a high

414
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.170
tolerance for inconvenience.

415
00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.800
>> Well, you know, it's a little thing where you don't feel the

416
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.630
pain that much. It's like, Oh, yeah. It took me five seconds to

417
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.560
find this definition instead of one second.

418
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.020
And maybe you don't do that operation enough

419
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.410
for it to matter, or it's like, just part of your work flow.

420
00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.690
So you keep

421
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.460
>> your like, uh,

422
00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.970
yeah, so anything I definitely think the

423
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.890
two league in 2020 was. You know, there's

424
00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.680
some major improvements that happened there. Um, for

425
00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.680
sure. So, yeah. Team G.H.C.

426
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.480
I.T. always the old reliable at this

427
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.400
point, HLS is the cool, new shiny toy

428
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.180
that you know, has a squeaky wheel here and there.

429
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.540
Mhm So. But yeah. So then

430
00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.160
he kind of moves on talking about

431
00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.300
the release of G.H.C. nine. Done

432
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.550
done.

433
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.000
>> Yeah, that's a big one. Which maybe we should do a whole

434
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.850
episode on that, But I feel like I'm not qualified for it

435
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.570
because the big like, you know, headline release

436
00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.310
or feature for G.H.C. nine is linear

437
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.710
types, which are really exciting,

438
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.610
but I don't really know anything

439
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:45.060
about them, so

440
00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.690
>> Okay, it will be good. Maybe we'll learn about it and then talk

441
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.560
about it will be good practice. Good. Yeah,

442
00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.530
>> but yeah. The first release candidate for G.H.C.

443
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.460
nine was released. Um, I think I installed it

444
00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.780
on one of my machines, but I haven't really played with it yet.

445
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.870
>> Mhm. Yeah, I haven't

446
00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.190
at all. Didn't even know there is a pre release version s

447
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.190
So you know, that's how in the no. I am here. Uh,

448
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.850
just hosting the high school weekly podcast. No big deal.

449
00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.460
Yeah, Kind of.

450
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.500
>> Haskell. Wait. There's a G.H.C. nine.

451
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.240
>> What's G.H.C.

452
00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.550
e you thug?

453
00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.760
Yeah. Hugs. Not drugs

454
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.640
any. Uh yeah. And then

455
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.130
another great thing that happened in 2020 that was

456
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.770
announced near the end. Was the high school

457
00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.620
foundation being formed? I think that was

458
00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.770
a big win for 2020.

459
00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.020
>> Yeah, I'm really looking forward to seeing where that

460
00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.860
goes. Right now, it's kind of nebulous, like it is a

461
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.520
good thing that it's there and they've secured a bunch of funding

462
00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.680
and all the right people are involved. But

463
00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.060
what are they going to do? I want to see what

464
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:52.560
happens.

465
00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.670
>> Yes, we can all sit there like Petr

466
00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.840
Marty Katz. And with someone maniacal

467
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.150
cackle, Mr

468
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.060
>> Bigglesworth. Yeah, yeah,

469
00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.670
but, um but yeah, those are definitely things, like maybe at

470
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.090
the end of 2021 we'll look back and

471
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.880
say, you know, G.H.C. nine was this

472
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.750
watershed moment for the community. Linear types

473
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.670
are amazing and change the world. Um,

474
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.500
and Haskell Foundation united all these disparate

475
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.440
projects and really helped push the ball forward or push

476
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.670
the lift the boat up, Whatever the expression is,

477
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.750
rather yeah, row the boat. Get everyone

478
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.750
rowing in the same direction. There we go. We got there.

479
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.100
>> Lift. Lift the boat. Uh,

480
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.000
rising.

481
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.290
>> Rising tide lifts all boats is what I was going for,

482
00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.270
>> but oh, God, you They're all rising.

483
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.240
Tides were just pouring

484
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.060
>> water into the ocean. Yeah, there's too many idioms to pick from.

485
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.940
>> Yeah, you mixed him up. That's okay. We like we like,

486
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.070
emerged stuff here.

487
00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.450
Yeah. Yeah. So I'm gonna

488
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.120
put you back on the spot against you. You denied My

489
00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.400
last time I asked the question, but what

490
00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.360
was? Yeah, one thing that sticks out in your mind of

491
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.050
something you learned in 2020 can be meta.

492
00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.680
It could be code related. It could be

493
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:05.900
so

494
00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:08.890
>> So I got something. It's kind of code related, and it's actually my,

495
00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.840
um, my resolution for this

496
00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.370
year, and it is to write less

497
00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.990
code at work. So for

498
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:19.600
those listeners that aren't employees of I.T.

499
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.420
pro um, I I managed the team of

500
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.190
engineers here, but I also in the past year

501
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:28.160
and my whole time here, have done a lot of engineering myself,

502
00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:30.660
and I've found that, um,

503
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.860
it can often I often use that as like a short cut of like, I

504
00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.460
know how I want this done, so I'll just do it.

505
00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.350
But that kind of Rob's everyone else on the team of that

506
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.130
opportunity of poking around and trying it out and

507
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.100
seeing what works and what doesn't work. So one of my goals for the new

508
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.020
year is, too. Let my team

509
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.920
explore the space of how to solve problems,

510
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.480
and I'll be happy to give direction and coach.

511
00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.360
But I want to write less code at

512
00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.250
>> work. Can I have that resolution to

513
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.170
the whole team.

514
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.370
>> Can't write less code. Or maybe

515
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:06.120
>> we can. Maybe that's what we should go for it. Yeah, just

516
00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.470
minimalistic. I mean, Dutch skin.

517
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.900
No, I think there's a lot to learn in 2021. Looking forward.

518
00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.740
Toa writing more code? Yeah. Solving more

519
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.360
problems.

520
00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.780
>> Yeah. Oh, that reminds me. Um,

521
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.950
I gave up on the advent of code on, like, day

522
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:24.920
22 or 23. We were talking about that. And I think the last time

523
00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.870
we recorded How did you do on a camp?

524
00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.970
>> Chuckles just chuckles.

525
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.660
I mean, if you count getting through

526
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.170
day four. Part one is a wind, then, Yeah,

527
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.740
I think it's further than I made it in any other years of

528
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.130
avenue code. I think I totally skipped it in

529
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.060
2019 and 2018. I did like,

530
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.860
a couple of days. It's just hard to like,

531
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.420
Yeah, I didn't have a ton of, like, you know, here at

532
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.310
the house. We've got a new puppy. We were doing

533
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:59.040
home renovations. So, like, doing stuff outside of

534
00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.470
work is generally not coding

535
00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.970
s. So

536
00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.900
>> it takes a surprising amount of time. Even if you're good

537
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.460
at those types of puzzles You still have to, like,

538
00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.690
read it and understand what it's asking and try it out and

539
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:14.560
debug it. And, you know, then you want to write, you know, make your own

540
00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.200
code better and all that. So, yeah, it's it's a big time

541
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:17.670
commitment.

542
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.040
>> Yeah, it wasn't Wasn't ready for it. Yeah,

543
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.920
So maybe I'll prep everything next year and just be

544
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.790
like, all right. From December 1st to

545
00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:29.680
December 25th, I code. I

546
00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.650
>> got an hour a day blocked out on my calendar. Don't interrupt

547
00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:32.950
me.

548
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.900
>> Yeah, just take off time of work. It's like,

549
00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:38.650
take my sick, sick days like an hour

550
00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.640
every day spread one sick day over a

551
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.180
whole week. Yeah. Can I make that work?

552
00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.640
We'll see. HR must have to weigh in on

553
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.070
that. Fair enough, But

554
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.870
yeah, so you know that's

555
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:55.030
2020. Now we're heading into

556
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.970
2021. And, you know, we've got a new

557
00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.100
slew of opportunities for high school weekly podcast, and

558
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.040
we actually also would love to invite any of our listeners

559
00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.660
or block post authors who are

560
00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.550
interested in maybe sharing what they have to say on high

561
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.830
school podcast we love for you to reach out.

562
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.060
Um, Taylor, where can they find us?

563
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.840
>> Yeah, I was gonna say, uh, we have mentioned that before, kind of

564
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.700
in passing. But really, if you want to be a guest on the podcast, if you got something to

565
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.680
say or if we have grossly misrepresented one of your own

566
00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.070
block posts, please come on and correct the record.

>> but shell phone

584
00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.970
just you know

585
00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.490
anything? Let's not get into song here.

586
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.000
Uh, yeah. No. So thank you. All

587
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.550
listeners who joined us today. We really

588
00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:20.330
enjoyed having Taylor on the show. Thank you again,

589
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:20.770
man.

590
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.450
>> Yeah, thanks for hosting. And, uh, you know,

591
00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.350
hopefully my another one of my resolutions here in

592
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:29.690
2021 is to actually record one of these

593
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.670
podcasts every week. We did pretty good toward the end of the

594
00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:35.660
year last year on, we did pretty good when we started, but there have

595
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.480
been some big sabbaticals in between. So

596
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.630
this year, hopefully we'll do better.

597
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.540
>> Hopefully, this year will be consistent because, um,

598
00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:45.550
you know, our sponsor I.T. pro T.V. is allowing

599
00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:48.430
us to do this. And so we wanna thank them. Um, they also

600
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:51.130
want to thank you for listening. So if you're interested in

601
00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.040
I.T. pro T.V. ve learning platform for I.T.

602
00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.750
professionals, I encourage you to goto I.T. pro dot

603
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.490
T.V. and see what we have to offer. And if you're

604
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.410
interested in a subscription, uh, there is a promo

605
00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:04.950
code available to you. It is Haskell Weekly

add? Taylor?

612
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.340

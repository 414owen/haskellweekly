00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,150
>> Hello and welcome to the Haskell Weekly

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,680
podcast. As you might have guessed, this

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,029
show is about Haskell, a purely

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,070
functional programming language.

5
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,410
I'm your host Cameron Gera. I'm an

6
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,599
engineer here at ITProTV, and with me

7
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,880
today we have ...
>> Jose Silvestri. I'm

8
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,130
an intern at ITProTV.
>> Woo! We got our

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,930
intern in here. He's pretty witty,

10
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,199
pretty cool. We're excited to have you on

11
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,830
the show today, man.
>> Thank you man, appreciate it.
>> Jose, what are we

12
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,250
talking about today?

13
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:31,519
>> So we're talking about our Haskell

14
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:34,910
survey.
>> Well it's not OUR Haskell survey,

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,430
it's THE Haskell survey.
>> THE Haskell survey.
>> It's big --

16
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:40,039
it's big time guys, it's big time. But no,

17
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,289
Taylor, our -- he was also on this

18
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,899
podcast a lot. He kind of put together

19
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:46,760
this Haskell survey that he does.

20
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:49,070
He's done this for two years now, well

21
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,930
this will be his third year. So kind of

22
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,660
putting, you know, a survey out to kind of

23
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,520
get the temperature of, you know, Haskell.

24
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,070
What the community wants,

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,170
what the community commonly uses, what

26
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:04,100
kind of trends and stuff like

27
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,540
that, you know. What does the Haskell

28
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,780
-- you know, what did the Haskell

29
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,860
survey kind of glean for you, as you did

30
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,130
it?
>> Yeah

31
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:16,100
I really thought -- there's a section

32
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:19,460
on it of what would I like to see more

33
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,530
of content-wise about Haskell, and that

34
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,520
was a really useful thing to me because

35
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:28,820
I feel like there's certain areas of,

36
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:32,120
sort of, the Haskell info sphere that

37
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:34,160
are very lacking, and I think surveys

38
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,590
like this are very useful on that

39
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,510
end, just for people to see what

40
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,250
the community wants, what's missing, what

41
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,610
type of content needs to be made and so

42
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:46,400
on.
>> Right, yeah. I think, you know, for me

43
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,530
taking the survey for the second year,

44
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,140
you know, looking at it this year, it's

45
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,430
very, you know, there was, you know, a section

46
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,260
on community. How do you feel like you

47
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,360
fit into the community, do you feel like

48
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,430
it's welcoming, do you feel like you can

49
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,980
communicate with people. And I think

50
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,210
that's one thing, you know,

51
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,400
as I looked at those questions

52
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,100
was like, I probably haven't plugged in to

53
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,320
the Haskell community as much as I want to,

54
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,550
you know. But you kind of use

55
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,040
all these things that are out there but

56
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,110
it was kind of a good introspective to

57
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,640
look at like, oh we should probably be

58
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,360
in the community a little bit more.
>> For

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,340
sure. And also it's a good place

60
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,470
I guess see what avenues of

61
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,210
communication there are. It's also a really

62
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,650
nice list just to see what's out there.

63
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:30,320
>> Yeah Taylor did a very thorough

64
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,850
job of making sure you know all the

65
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,320
stuff's out there. But I'm also you know

66
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,720
we want you to know: these surveys,

67
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,100
these are -- there's more surveys like this

68
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,860
out there, you know. I know Stack Overflow

69
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,570
does, you know, development for the year

70
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,100
and kind of, you know, you can see the

71
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,660
temperature of who's using what

72
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,730
programming languages, what tools they're

73
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,350
using, stuff like that. And so I think

74
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,390
this was really nice to kind of dive in.

75
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:53,840
This one specifically to dive into Haskell

76
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,790
you know being a mostly Haskell

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,880
programmer now. It was

78
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:02,720
cool to kind of put in my input.
>> Yeah for

79
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,130
sure. I think getting the temperature of

80
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,080
the Haskell community is particularly

81
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,390
important for our community.
>> Right right right.

82
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,250
We want to -- the Haskell community as

83
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,630
a whole is kind of, you know, it's there,

84
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,480
but it's been under the, you know --

85
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:17,930
underneath and, you know, there's not

86
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,090
really a lot of: "Oh, Haskell! Using Haskell, that's

87
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,610
awesome!" People like: "You're using Haskell,

88
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,650
what's that?" So getting a

89
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,870
survey out like this can, you know, kind

90
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,459
of get, you know -- cause there's I mean

91
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,190
looking at the survey results from the

92
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:33,709
previous years, which will link to in the

93
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,989
show notes here, but you know there's

94
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,400
trends you see of like, there's people

95
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:39,080
who fill out the survey who have never

96
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,180
touched Haskell, but they found it.

97
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,910
And like that's exposure you know. So

98
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,769
surveys like this kind of open up,

99
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:48,560
you know, opportunities for people to

100
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:51,140
learn about programming languages. In our

101
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,930
case, Haskell.
>> Yeah for sure.

102
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:56,840
It's really good to get some feedback on

103
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,700
the accessibility of our community, not

104
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,540
only in terms of the people in it, but

105
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,310
also, we are sort of in a community where

106
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,440
we have very specific -- a very specific

107
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,720
language for talking about things, and

108
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:13,489
let me be off-putting to a lot of people.

109
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,440
I feel like maybe getting people's

110
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:16,910
feedback on that, that are not part --

111
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,910
already part of the community, and how

112
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,829
they sort of internalize this

113
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,470
language when they first hear it.

114
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,670
>> It's very interesting.
>> Yeah, no and I

115
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,740
think that's ...

116
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,480
Haskell seems like this

117
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,880
big bad scary thing, and I think a lot of

118
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,830
people carry that. And you know this

119
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,630
survey allows us to kind of get the

120
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,990
temperature. Is that really the case or

121
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,880
is that just something we're saying?

122
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,310
So I'm really excited about this year's

123
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,380
survey. And you know, because now we'll

124
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,360
have three years of data, I know we'll

125
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,890
kind of be analyzing some trends a

126
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,290
little bit more. I know we want to get

127
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,700
this data out to the community and out

128
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,130
to the development community as a whole,

129
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,360
but also the, you know, more particularly

130
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,090
the Haskell community, to kind of

131
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,520
see: "Oh, like ..." You know, "Oh Jose, you use

132
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,500
Visual Studio, like, oh there's another

133
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,300
thousand people who also use Visual

134
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,220
Studio. Maybe I should give it a try and

135
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,170
see what extensions there are, and you

136
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,840
know packages that will help me be a

137
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,730
more effective, you know, developer.

138
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,890
>> You know, when it comes to

139
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,150
dealing with Haskell." So you know there's

140
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,040
a lot of different cool things in there.

141
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,840
I would definitely recommend all of our

142
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,320
listeners here to go check it out.

143
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,690
It takes like, what -- five, ten minutes?

144
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,020
>> Yeah I literally filled that out while I

145
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,280
was waiting for my food to come out.

146
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,350
>> During lunch today he took the survey,

147
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,480
which is good, you know. We wanted

148
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,940
to be prepared for this podcast, so we

149
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,560
both took it today. But yeah I would

150
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,420
definitely recommend everyone to go

151
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,780
check it out. It is open until November

152
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,310
14th 2019, so be sure to fill that out

153
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,940
quick. The time is running out.

154
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:51,680
We have seven days left, so by the time --

155
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,030
it's just now the 7th, by the time

156
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,550
you guys get this in your hands, it may

157
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,880
be close to the deadline. So please,

158
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:01,190
please, please go check it out. But

159
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,720
yeah, you got any other, like -- what has

160
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,400
been your feedback and experience with

161
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,580
other surveys. Like how does the Haskell

162
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,610
survey compare?
>> I don't take

163
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:14,630
that many surveys, honestly. But this one

164
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:17,210
was, like -- I took it not only because I

165
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,520
know Taylor, but also because I do care

166
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,640
about this language and community, and I

167
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,400
think it's a very quick and very

168
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,600
effective way to help out our community.

169
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:33,080
And hopefully sort of be a little nudge

170
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,550
in the right direction.
>> Right yeah yeah. I

171
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,770
don't take a lot of surveys either so it

172
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,900
really was a loaded question, I'm sorry. But

173
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,620
you know it's one of the things

174
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,390
that

175
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,490
nobody has really a lot of time to take

176
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:46,070
surveys, but I definitely encourage all

177
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,570
of you to check it out. But I think we're

178
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,000
gonna keep this episode short. Was there

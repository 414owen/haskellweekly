00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,150
hello and welcome to haskell weekly

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,680
podcast as you might have guessed this

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,029
shows about highschool a purely

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,070
functional programming language

5
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,410
I'm your host camera guerra I'm an

6
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,599
engineer here at IT pros TV and with me

7
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,880
today we have what's a Silvestri I'm

8
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,130
gonna internet IT pro TV whoo we got our

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,930
intern here he's a pretty pretty witty

10
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,199
pretty cool we're excited to have you on

11
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,830
the show today man thank you what are we

12
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,250
talking about today

13
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:31,519
so we're talking about our high school

14
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:34,910
survey well it's not our high school

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,430
it's the high school survey oh it's big

16
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:40,039
it's big time guys it's big time but no

17
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,289
Taylor our he was also also on this

18
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,899
podcast a lot he kind of put together

19
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:46,760
this past school survey that he does

20
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:49,070
he's done this for two years now well

21
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,930
this will be a third year so kind of

22
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,660
putting you know a survey out to kind of

23
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,520
get the temperature of you know half

24
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,070
school what what the community wants

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,170
what the community commonly uses what

26
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:04,100
what's kind of trends and stuff like

27
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,540
that you know what what does the Haskell

28
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,780
pot you know what did the high school

29
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,860
survey kind of glean for you as you did

30
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,130
it yeah

31
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:16,100
I really thought the there's a section

32
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:19,460
on it of what would I like to see more

33
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,530
of content wise about Haskell and that

34
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,520
was a really useful thing to me because

35
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:28,820
I feel like there's certain areas of

36
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:32,120
sort of Haskell's InfoSphere right that

37
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:34,160
are very lacking and I think service

38
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,590
like this like are very useful on that

39
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,510
end just for people to see what's what

40
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,250
the community wants what's missing what

41
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,610
type of content needs to be made and so

42
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:46,400
on right yeah I think you know for me

43
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,530
taking up the survey for the second year

44
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,140
you know looking at it this year it's

45
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,430
very you know there was you know section

46
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,260
on community how do you feel like you

47
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,360
fit into the community do you feel like

48
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,430
it's welcoming do you feel like you can

49
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,980
communicate with people and I think

50
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,210
that's one thing you know I like ask

51
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,400
that you don't look to those questions

52
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,100
was like I probably haven't plugged in

53
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,320
the house community as much as I want to

54
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,550
you know be but you know you kind of use

55
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,040
all these things that are out there but

56
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,110
it was kind of a good introspective to

57
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,640
look at like oh we should probably

58
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,360
in the community a little bit more for

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,340
sure and also like it it's a good place

60
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,470
I guess see what avenues of

61
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,210
communication there are it's also really

62
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,650
nice list just to see what's out there

63
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:30,320
oh yeah yeah Taylor did a very thorough

64
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,850
job of making sure you know all the

65
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,320
stuffs out there but I'm also you know

66
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,720
we want you to know like these surveys

67
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,100
these are there's more surveys like this

68
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,860
out there you know I know Stack Overflow

69
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,570
does you know development for the year

70
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,100
and kind of you know you can see the

71
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,660
temperature of who's using what

72
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,730
programming leaders is what tools are

73
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,350
using stuff like that and so I think

74
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,390
this was really nice to kind of dive in

75
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:53,840
this one specifically to dive into high

76
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,790
school you know being a mostly high

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,880
school program right now yeah it was

78
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:02,720
cool to kind of put in my input yeah for

79
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,130
sure I think getting the temperature of

80
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,080
the house I mean it is particularly

81
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,390
important for our community right right

82
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,250
we want to yeah the house community of

83
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,630
the whole is kind of you know it's there

84
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,480
but it's been under the you know

85
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:17,930
underneath and yeah you know there's not

86
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,090
really a lot of Oh high school usually

87
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,610
awesome people like you're using high

88
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,650
school what's that so yeah giving a

89
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,870
survey out like this can you know kind

90
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,459
of get you know cuz there's I mean

91
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,190
looking at the survey results from the

92
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:33,709
previous years which will link to in the

93
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,989
show notes here but you know there's

94
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,400
trends you see of like there's people

95
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:39,080
who fill out the survey who have never

96
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,180
touched high school but they found it

97
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,910
and like that's exposure you know so

98
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,769
yeah surveys like this kind of opened up

99
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:48,560
you know opportunities for people to

100
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:51,140
learn about programming languages in our

101
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,930
case Haskell yeah for sure

102
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:56,840
it's really good to get some feedback on

103
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,700
the accessibility of our community not

104
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,540
only in terms of the people in it but

105
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,310
also we are sort of in a community where

106
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,440
we have very specific at very specific

107
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,720
language for talking about things and

108
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:13,489
let me be off-putting to a lot of people

109
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,440
I feel like maybe getting people's

110
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:16,910
feedback on that that are not part

111
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,910
already part of the community and how

112
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,829
they let's sort of internalize this

113
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,470
language when they first hear it right

114
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,670
it's very interesting ya know and I

115
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,740
think that's

116
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,480
yeah it's high school seems like this

117
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,880
big bad scary thing and I think a lot of

118
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,830
people carry that and you know this

119
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,630
survey allows us to kind of get the

120
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,990
temperature is that really the case or

121
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,880
is that just something we're saying yeah

122
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,310
so I'm really excited about this year's

123
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,380
survey and you know because now we'll

124
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,360
have three years of data I know will

125
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,890
kind of be maybe analyzing some trends a

126
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,290
little bit more I know we want to get

127
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,700
this data out to the community and out

128
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,130
to the development community as a whole

129
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,360
but also the you know more particularly

130
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,090
if they ask will community to kind of

131
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,520
see oh like you know oh Jose you use

132
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,500
Visual Studio like oh there's another

133
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,300
thousand people who also use Visual

134
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,220
Studio maybe I should give it a try and

135
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,170
see what extensions there are and you

136
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,840
know packages that will help me be a

137
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,730
more effective you know developer for

138
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,890
sure um you know when it comes to

139
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,150
dealing with Haskell so you know there's

140
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,040
a lot of different cool things in there

141
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,840
I would definitely recommend all of our

142
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,320
listeners here to go check it out

143
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,690
it's takes like what five ten minutes

144
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,020
yeah I literally filled that out while I

145
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,280
was waiting for my food to come out like

146
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,350
during lunch today he took the survey

147
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,480
which is good you know I got we wanted

148
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,940
to be prepared for this podcast so we

149
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,560
both took it today but yeah I would

150
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,420
definitely recommend everyone to go

151
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,780
check it out it is open until November

152
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,310
14th 2019 so be sure to fill that out

153
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,940
quick though the time is running out

154
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:51,680
we're of seven days left so by the time

155
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,030
it's just now the seventh by the time

156
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,550
you guys get this in your hands it may

157
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,880
be close to the deadline so please

158
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:01,190
please please go go check it out but

159
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,720
yeah yet you know they're like what has

160
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,400
been your feedback and experience with

161
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,580
other surveys like what how does Hass

162
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,610
will start breaking pear oh I'll take

163
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:14,630
that many survey so I'm so but this one

164
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:17,210
was like I took it not only because I

165
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,520
know Taylor but also because I do care

166
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,640
about this language and community and I

167
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,400
think it's a very quick and very

168
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,600
effective way to help out our community

169
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:33,080
and hopefully sort of be a little nudge

170
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,550
in the right direction right yeah yeah I

171
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,770
don't take a lot of surveys either so I

172
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,900
really a lot of questions I'm sorry but

173
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,620
okay you know it's one of the things

174
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,390
that

175
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,490
nobody has really a lot of time to take

176
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:46,070
surveys but I definitely encourage all

177
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,570
of you to check it out but I think we're

178
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,000
gonna keep this episode short was

179
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,820
anything else you want to touch on Oh

180
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,920
not really but yeah we just wanted to

181
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,810
get the word out about the survey and

182
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,080
encourage you guys to if you're

183
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:03,020

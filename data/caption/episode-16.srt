00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:05,670
hello and welcome to the Haskell weekly

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,560
podcast as you might have guessed this

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,120
show is about Haskell which is a purely

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,880
functional programming language

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,700
I'm your host Dustin seekers and I'm an

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,980
engineer here at IT Pro TV hi I'm Cody

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,590
Goodman I'm a senior engineer here at

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,869
IPTV where were you talking about today

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,820
desam we're talking about game

10
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,519
development in Haskell I thought it

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,039
would be cool to kind of bring together

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,679
my love of game development in games

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,570
video games in general and Haskell which

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,370
is what I use daily here at Ida Pro TV I

15
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,350
was gonna actually have a few questions

16
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,410
for you and I figured it would be cool

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,200
to kind of just look into the Haskell

18
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,989
game dev community in space and see what

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,629
all was out there yeah I think a lot of

20
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,340
people are in your position you know if

21
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,920
you browse the Haskell subreddit you'll

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,390
see occasionally questions about people

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,660
wanting to make games and people

24
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,039
frustrated trying to make games so if if

25
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,020
you don't take the right path that can

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,930
be pretty frustrating

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,820
one recommendation I've seen over the

28
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,369
years and tried a little myself is to

29
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,010
start out with a 2d library called gloss

30
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,770
Ketchum have you ever heard of it yeah

31
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,830
actually our lead engineer I think he

32
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:20,180
did a few just very basic games using

33
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:24,090
gloss I heard it was super intuitive and

34
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:26,610
quick to get something up on the screen

35
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,829
right right yeah that's that's one of

36
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,320
the reasons I recommend it and I think a

37
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,090
lot of other people recommend it is you

38
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,280
can you can draw a window and draw a

39
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,470
circle and a single line and it's all

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,930
and you know plain English words that

41
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,600
you might be able to guess yourself nice

42
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,520
you know glosses really aimed at

43
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,060
simplicity there's a ton of tutorials

44
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,399
available not just like basic tutorials

45
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,649
but tutorials of you know how do you

46
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,899
make pong oh yeah right

47
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,939
it's more of an end-to-end thing which

48
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,040
has schools sorely lacking in other

49
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,259
areas but when you're just getting

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,200
started and it's a new paradigm a new

51
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,149
language you you need you know a little

52
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,520
bit hand-holding to just get all the way

53
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,520
from point A to point B at least exactly

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,200
at least once mm-hmm so that's it

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,900
so gloss seems really attractive to me

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,489
in that as

57
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,450
fact mainly because I'm not super

58
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:20,890
proficient in Haskell I've only been

59
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:24,970
doing it for a little while

60
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:27,640
but I do enjoy it and I think I have

61
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:31,840
more experience in game development

62
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:34,030
mainly as a hobby right versus you know

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,909
programming in Haskell so I would like

64
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,010
to merge both of them and Glaus seems

65
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:39,370
like a pretty good pretty good way to do

66
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,030
that

67
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:46,209
yes and for people trying to merge their

68
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:49,000
game development experience or interest

69
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:51,220
in their love Haskell he'll probably run

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,200
into a functional reactive programming

71
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,299
which you know if you are really in

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,609
proficient in high school it can be a

73
00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:00,780
bit of a mind bender to wrap your head

74
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:02,590
around that can't you yeah I actually

75
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,670
just doing a little bit of research

76
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,409
before this podcast we stumbled upon FRP

77
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,889
functional reactive programming and then

78
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:15,579
also just your classic main iterating

79
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:19,780
over your main game loop and do you have

80
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:22,840
any like I guess a concise way if you

81
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:26,699
could explain functional reactive

82
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,569
programming to those who don't know I

83
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:31,720
didn't come up with the best answer

84
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:34,690
myself but I I looked around and hope I

85
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,780
see the name right here T cons Elvis as

86
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,190
they a talk on answering that that

87
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,069
question you know you have to have a

88
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,959
whole talk to answer it yeah he says if

89
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:46,959
I had to summarize it in one sentence I

90
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:49,479
would say that functional reactive

91
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,229
programming is programming with time

92
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:54,940
varying values now that's not the most

93
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:58,269
satisfying answer for someone who might

94
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:03,760
already be overwhelmed yeah yeah but

95
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:06,489
basically that's for lack of anything

96
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,909
better to use at this moment it's state

97
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:12,909
right like represent state yeah it's a

98
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:14,819
lot like state the so it still encodes

99
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:19,090
the information that state would encode

100
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:20,919
the difference would be that the way

101
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:23,110
that these things compose together are

102
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:24,909
different we won't get too deep into

103
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,860
that and that's one of the reasons we

104
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:29,919
recommend gloss to start

105
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,310
with yeah so you can just you know gloss

106
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,900
over

107
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:38,590
FRP yeah let's see what you did there

108
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:41,379
okay cool so do we have any like games

109
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:44,139
that may have used FRP and examples of

110
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:47,020
that or up top your head yeah any

111
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:49,810
packages that might implement or use

112
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,919
this yeah a recent recent really cool

113
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:57,310
game with a an interesting premise that

114
00:04:52,919 --> 00:05:02,169
we might recognize the roots of is

115
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:05,650
people Mon yes I did see that I believe

116
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:10,569
is by Alex Stewart correct right right

117
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:14,139
and so the premise is that you you catch

118
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:16,449
people and in battle with them and style

119
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:19,240
of Pokemon and I got you that's pretty

120
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:21,849
funny yeah I did I got a chance to at

121
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,189
least watch the little trailer for it

122
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:26,860
and go to the site but I have not yet

123
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:28,629
played it I planned to play it mmm-hmm

124
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,969
here it's it's pretty short but looks

125
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:33,400
pretty entertaining at the very least oh

126
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:36,009
and I recommend at least check out their

127
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:42,940
homepage pretty hilarious images on the

128
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:46,599
gadget let's see so people Mon what was

129
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:50,110
it based on it was Yampa I think okay

130
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:52,210
which is an FRP library you'll notice

131
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,870
that the more complex examples of high

132
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,729
school games use FRP I think we had an

133
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:01,740
exception which used your classic game

134
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:06,460
loop which we'll talk about in a second

135
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:10,060
but just to answer why these libraries

136
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,870
might prefer FRP as as complexity scales

137
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,580
up FRP

138
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,620
seems to have some advantages over the

139
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,740
classic game loop much in the way that

140
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,689
Haskell has advantages over imperative

141
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,930
languages oh yeah that actually reminds

142
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:29,740
me Cody we will be linking the package

143
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:32,199
Yampa as well as people maan and other

144
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,130
things mentioned in this podcast on our

145
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:39,190
Haskell weekly podcast page so if you're

146
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:40,840
you know interested in you know finding

147
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,510
these not really having to Google

148
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,160
even though you totally can we'll have

149
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,139
those links available at the Haskell

150
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,000
weekly podcast page but the mention of

151
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:52,780
people Mon and then also Pokemon which

152
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,190
is a mainstream game I will found out

153
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:58,690
just a little while ago that there was

154
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,180
actually a Haskell game that was

155
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,669
greenlit on Steam now they've retired

156
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,820
the whole greenlight thing on Steam but

157
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:09,460
so this is a little bit older but it was

158
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,919
still pretty cool to see that I think it

159
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:14,050
was even back in 2012 right people were

160
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,419
using Haskell to create games and yeah

161
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,410
they actually you know we're we're

162
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:21,370
getting somewhere with it

163
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:24,730
trailblazers for sure that was Nikki in

164
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:27,990
the robots and I remember watching on

165
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:30,850
excitedly in their development blog and

166
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,830
tracking their progress trying to get

167
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,330
everything building myself it was

168
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,760
exciting and then to see that they got

169
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:39,460
on Steam greenlight it was like wow so

170
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,110
in 2012 it's possible to write a high

171
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,830
school game if you put in enough effort

172
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,930
and get it greenlit on Steam it's

173
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,270
actually really cool yeah I noticed that

174
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,419
um I went to their page and I did a

175
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:54,610
little a little snooping around and I

176
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:58,419
saw their tech stack consisted of

177
00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:01,330
Hipmunk which is the physics engine

178
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:04,479
right yeah it's a Haskell take on

179
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,650
chipmunk mm-hmm which is pretty cool

180
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,660
it looks like the package is now

181
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,760
deprecated so it might be a little old

182
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,280
but it was still nice and cool to see

183
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,350
that you know the community is out there

184
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,200
and they're doing things with it

185
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:20,350
yeah you know I rewatched Nicki in the

186
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:23,650
robots video after after looking around

187
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:25,240
for some examples and it just made me

188
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,640
think you know what would it take to

189
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,229
revive Nicki and the robots and make it

190
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,810
something compiling something that

191
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:33,610
people for instance in this podcast you

192
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,169
heard about this could go and download

193
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,719
the source code and try it out

194
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:40,870
you know much work is it to update that

195
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,729
there was an older FPS game made in

196
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,760
highschool I can't recall the name of it

197
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:47,830
but somebody did the work to like bring

198
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,610
it current oh well is it really cool

199
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,820
nice

200
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,950
maybe somebody maybe me maybe you or

201
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,380
someone hearing this can try to revive

202
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,160
Nick

203
00:08:54,380 --> 00:09:01,760
the robot right and it's also just it

204
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,520
would be good to I guess have something

205
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,730
else to do to emergencies I guess these

206
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,190
hobbies and this love of a Haskell

207
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:13,850
together and which would help progress

208
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:15,920
you know my skill in Haskell as well so

209
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:19,130
I guess that's like another right

210
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,730
another bonus doing this on the topic of

211
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:23,750
that there is also Dino rush which you

212
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,720
know if you're wanting to merge your

213
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:28,550
hobbies of high school and game

214
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,080
development but you're kind of new you

215
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,810
might want to use like a classic game

216
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,820
loop and Dino rush actually went that

217
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,940
route and they used a class a game loop

218
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,660
so highly recommend anyone who wants to

219
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,540
do that

220
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,130
to check out their blog post that I

221
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,580
think you're probably going to put the

222
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:48,950
resources to yes download the source

223
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:52,100
code get it building poke around in

224
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:54,800
there nice yeah I'm definitely gonna do

225
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,080
that actually went to the page earlier

226
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,620
and checked it out and it's it's pretty

227
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,840
cool I like the the pixel art for the

228
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,350
game it looks pretty right and in for

229
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,940
context the game diner rush it's you

230
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:12,620
know when you lose internet connection

231
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,970
on Google Chrome yes jump over stuff I

232
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:20,900
think we have a high scoreboard

233
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:23,960
something around in the office those

234
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:26,720
examples are pretty inspiring Cody but

235
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,730
if I get lost how could I get support

236
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,200
right you know we were talking about

237
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,780
Nikki and the robots and their

238
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,430
trailblazers there wasn't there weren't

239
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,410
really a lot of people trying to do high

240
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,660
school game dev back then so they had to

241
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,430
figure out all those things herself but

242
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:43,220
then at some point past that they

243
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:48,220
started a or someone started a subreddit

244
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:51,710
called our slash Haskell game dev and

245
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:54,050
they made a wiki of how to get started

246
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:57,890
now they're getting started I think is

247
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:59,540
more fitted to complex games and I would

248
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,450
still recommend using gloss to get

249
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:05,600
started since it'll won't get you up and

250
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:08,360
running the fastest but some really good

251
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,870
resources there they also have

252
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:15,260
a Haskell game dev channel on freenode

253
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:17,720
if you're familiar with IRC chat and you

254
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,970
can usually get pretty quick help in the

255
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,570
Haskell chat room I'm guessing the

256
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:25,820
Haskell game dev is similar then there's

257
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:28,250
always Stack Overflow I've noticed quite

258
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,490
a few game to have questions and asked

259
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,529
will get answered on Stack Overflow

260
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:36,850
gotcha nice yeah I'll definitely give

261
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:40,220
those a shot and just to clarify

262
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:43,190
somebody coming from let's say unity3d

263
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,500
developing there there's nothing like

264
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:49,190
that currently for the Haskell community

265
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:52,490
right like it's basically c-sharp for

266
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:55,720
the most part in Wright unity right yeah

267
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:59,120
nothing is complete as unity there is a

268
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,279
game engine that I think attempted to be

269
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,040
something like unity called helm that

270
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,890
you might want to take a look at I think

271
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:10,490
it still compiles the latest GHC and is

272
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:13,310
is working couldn't find any good game

273
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,839
examples of it though gotcha okay cool

274
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,329
thanks for being on the show with me

00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,279

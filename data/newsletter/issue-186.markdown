## In brief

- [Variational Autoencoders in Haskell, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Turn My Friends Into Dogs](https://www.declanoller.com/2019/11/15/variational-autoencoders-in-haskell-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-turn-my-friends-into-dogs/) by Declan Oller
  > If you frequently wander down the dark alleys of the computer science neighborhood of the internet, it won’t be too long before you bump into a strange man in a trench coat who says “hey, kid… you ever try Functional Programming?”

- [A dead-simple web stack in Haskell](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-11-16-a-dead-simple-web-stack.html) by William Yao
  > Haskell has a proliferation of libraries to choose from for all of your basic backend needs, from logging to database access to routing and web server definition. It’s nice to have the freedom of choice, but if you’re just starting out, the amount of decisions needed can be overwhelming.

- [Winter is coming even more quickly](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/758-Winter_is_coming_even_more_quickly) by Joachim Breitner
  > I explain how I improved the performance of an interpreter for WebAssembly written in Haskell by plucking some low-hanging fruit.

- [Sum algebraic data types in C](https://nullbuffer.com/2019/11/15/algebraic_c.html) by Alessio Chiapperini
  > One can say that sum types feel a lot like a combination of unions and enumerations, and that’s true, in fact we’ll see how to implement various (sum) algebraic data types in C.

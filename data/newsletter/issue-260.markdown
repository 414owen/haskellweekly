Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Of function instances and abstract syntax](https://www.danielbrice.net/blog/of-function-instances-and-abstract-syntax/)
  > Some Haskell classes `class Myclass a` admit an instance for functions `instance Myclass a => Myclass (x -> a)` based on the instance for `a`. All of these instances have a few things in common: (1) they implement the class methods in a straightforward way as `mymethod f = \x -> mymethod (f x)`, and (2) they are polarizing among Haskell practitioners. The linked blog post is a case study of why one might find such instances compelling and useful.

Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Playground for Haskell](https://play-haskell.tomsmeding.com/play) by Tom Smeding & Julian Ospald
  > In the spirit of [play.rust-lang.org](https://play.rust-lang.org/). Run a snippet of Haskell code without installing anything, and share executable snippets with others. In [active development](https://github.com/tomsmeding/pastebin-haskell/blob/scalable-play/TODO.txt). (Know `bwrap`? Help us!)

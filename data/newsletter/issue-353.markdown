- [Fail with Class](https://alexey.kuleshevi.ch/blog/2023/01/16/fail-with-class/) by Alexey Kuleshevich
  > This post describes a very common failure pattern using `MonadFail`. It also introduces a small and hopefully useful `FailT` library that plays well with the `MonadFail` type class and makes dealing with failures just a bit easier.

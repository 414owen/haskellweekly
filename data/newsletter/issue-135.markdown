Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [My favorite Haskell function](https://github.com/quchen/articles/blob/c8540f28bca2049b35f48d242988ca1ca248d0d8/2018-11-22_zipWith_const.md)

    > My favorite Haskell function is zipWith const. It's tiny. It's in Prelude. It's awesome.

-   [Internal convention is a mistake](http://nikita-volkov.github.io/internal-convention-is-a-mistake/)

    > In this post I'm gonna highlight the issues of the "Internal" modularization convention and provide a proper solution to the same set of problems.

-   [Haskell and Rust](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2018/11/haskell-and-rust)

    > The learning curve of both Haskell and Rust is worthwhile. They are both platforms that you can invest deeply into for robust infrastructure and applications that perform well.

-   [Parsing type-level strings in Haskell](https://kcsongor.github.io/symbol-parsing-haskell/)

    > Any inductively defined data type can be used not only at the term level, but also at the type level. A notable exception are strings, which provide the main theme for today's blog post.

-   [Cursors, part 2: The text cursor](https://cs-syd.eu/posts/2018-11-28-cursors-text)

    > This is the second post in a series about cursors. It prepares the right data structure to write an editor for a single line of text.

-   [Tidal 1.0.0 refactor](https://slab.org/tidal-1-0-0-refactor/)

    > I've put a lot of time into Tidal the last couple of months, starting with preparation for an advanced tidal workshop in Tokyo, but things got out of hand and ended with a rewrite of its innards, solving some long-standing issues.

-   [Type Classes: The lessons continue](https://typeclasses.com/news/2018-11-lessons-continue)

    > Happy Thanksgiving! We each have a new lesson of each of our respective courses for you.

-   [Counting the cost of colons in Haskell](https://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2018/11/counting-cost-of-colons-in-haskell.html)

    > Haskell uses `::` as the type operator. That was a mistake that costs us over 1 million characters of source code.

## Jobs

-   [Haskell Developer at Cross Compass in Tokyo](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/a0iq61/job_cross_compass_is_currently_hiring_haskell/)

    > We currently have a small team of Haskellers working on a deep learning framework implemented in Haskell. We are hiring Haskell programmers to help create this framework.

-   [Language Engineer at Conduent in Raleigh](https://blockchain.works-hub.com/jobs/software-engineer-programming-languages-in-raleigh-united-states-of-america-a2f83)

    > We are looking for a software engineer with experience in Haskell or OCaml located in Raleigh, North Carolina. We are looking to implement our strategy of enabling our internal and external applications with a distributed ledger (a blockchain) to help deliver value to our customers.

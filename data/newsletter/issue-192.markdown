Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [A Few Haskell Highlights of 2019](https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-highlights-2019) by Gints Dreimanis
  > To close out the year, Iâ€™ve asked my coworkers about notable highlights from this year and separated the answers into 4 groups: releases, books, talks, and blog posts.
  
- [A plea to Haskellers everywhere: Write Junior Code](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2019/12/26/write_junior_code.html) by Matt Parsons
  > Let us grow Haskell in industry by writing simpler code and making room for the less experienced.
  
- [Software Design and Architecture in Haskell](https://github.com/graninas/software-design-in-haskell) by Alexander Granin
  > A structured set of materials on how to build real-world applications in Haskell.
  
- [Algebraic lenses](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/algebraic) by Chris Penner
  > The more that we realize the Category Theory representations of optics the more we can convince ourselves that they're a true and beautiful abstraction rather than just a useful tool we stumbled across.
  
- [Alternative `HasLens`](https://github.com/effectfully/sketches/tree/master/has-lens-done-right) by effectfully
  > This post first describes known approaches to constructing a `HasLens` class that allows to retrieve a `Lens` into a type. Then I outline a new possible solution and show how examples that are not convenient to handle with other solutions can be handled directly with the new one.
  
- [Keeping Database Tests Fast with `tmp-postgres`](https://jfischoff.github.io/blog/keeping-database-tests-fast.html) by Jonathan Fischoff
  > When testing with `tmp-postgres`, using `cacheAction`, `abort`, `rollback` and separate postgres instances can help keep test suites fast even as the project grows larger.

## Jobs
